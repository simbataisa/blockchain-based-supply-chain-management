# Blockchain Supply Chain Management System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A comprehensive blockchain-based supply chain management platform that enables secure, transparent, and immutable tracking of products from origin to consumer. The system leverages smart contracts for automated verification, real-time tracking capabilities, and role-based access controls to ensure data integrity and stakeholder accountability across the entire supply chain ecosystem.

The platform addresses critical supply chain challenges including lack of transparency, counterfeit products, inefficient inventory management, and compliance tracking while providing scalable infrastructure for enterprise-level operations.

## 3. Core Process

**Administrator Flow:**
System administrators manage the overall platform, deploy smart contracts, configure system parameters, and oversee user management. They monitor system health, handle escalated issues, and ensure compliance with security policies.

**Supplier Flow:**
Suppliers register products with detailed specifications, upload quality certificates, and initiate the supply chain process. They manage inventory levels, respond to quality inquiries, and maintain compliance documentation.

**Manufacturer Flow:**
Manufacturers receive raw materials, transform them into finished products, record production processes, and conduct quality assurance. They manage batch operations, update product specifications, and transfer products to distributors.

**Distributor Flow:**
Distributors receive products from manufacturers, manage warehouse operations, coordinate shipments, and track deliveries. They update location data, handle custody transfers, and ensure proper storage conditions.

**Retailer Flow:**
Retailers receive products from distributors, manage retail inventory, process customer sales, and handle returns. They provide product authenticity verification to consumers and maintain sales records.

**Quality Auditor Flow:**
Quality auditors conduct inspections at various supply chain stages, verify compliance with standards, record audit findings, and issue certifications. They investigate quality issues and maintain audit documentation.

**Consumer Flow:**
Consumers scan product codes to verify authenticity, view product history, check quality certifications, and report issues. They access transparency information and provide feedback on product quality.
